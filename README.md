# 🎨 Android OpenGL Shapes Demo

This project is a simple Android application that demonstrates basic OpenGL ES rendering using GLSurfaceView. It draws various shapes, including a square, a triangle, a rotated triangle, and a multicolored triangle, showcasing fundamental OpenGL concepts.

## 🚀 Features
- Draw Basic Shapes:
Renders a square and different types of triangles using OpenGL ES 2.0.
- Shape Transformations:
Includes a rotated triangle to demonstrate transformations (rotation).
- Color Handling:
Implements a multicolored triangle to showcase color interpolation and vertex coloring.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Kotlin/Java: Core programming languages.
- OpenGL ES 2.0: For rendering 2D shapes in a 3D space.
- GLSurfaceView: Provides a dedicated surface for OpenGL rendering.
- Android Studio: IDE for development and testing.
